This program takes a list and puts it through a for loop to print each object in the list. It then prints each odd number in descending order from range 99-33
'''


floatList = [3.2, 7.6, 5.3, 8.7, 1.37]
#prints each item in floatList
for i in floatList:
    print(i)

#prints all odd numbers from 99 to 33
for i in range(99,32,-2):
    print(i)
